### Problems:
- Store customers have to wait for the bottle deposit machines to be emptied, before they can continue using them. This may take a long time due to manuality of emptying process (employees have to gather all the bottles by hand).
- Store managers cannot predict amount of bottles deposited daily, which hinders efficient resource planning.

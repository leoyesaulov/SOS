# SOS (Smart Omni Solutions)

### Problems:
- Store customers have to wait for the bottle deposit machines to be emptied, before they can continue using them. This may take a long time due to manuality of emptying process (employees have to gather all the bottles by hand).
- Store managers cannot predict amount of bottles deposited daily, which hinders efficient resource planning.

### Assumptions:
- We have access to camera feed of the table.
- We have access to REWE customer's receipts.
- We have access to bottle deposit machine internal data (amount of bottles, type, date etc).
- We have access to table's sensors and are able to install new one's.
- We have access to MOTOTRBO (Motorola's software libraries).
- We have access to broadcasting across employee's walkie-talkies.

### Solution: 
- Add another sensor on 80% of the table.
- Connect new sensor to our system.
- Log it's entries and send preemptive broadcasts to employees.

### Why: 
Such solution will:
1. Gather data on machine usage.
2. Give employees the possibility to react before machine stops running, ensuring 24/7 availability for the customers.
